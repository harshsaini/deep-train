# deep-train
A collection of generic training scripts that can be used with popular Deep
Learning frameworks following best practices.


## Aim

These scripts are aimed to abstract out the common boilerplate for training
deep learning models in various frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow.

## TODO

- [ ] Add PyTorch scripts
- [ ] Add Tensorflow scripts
- [ ] Add Keras scripts
